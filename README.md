Qute Hack Ideas (Part 1)

_Hint:_ There is a separate markup for each of these ideas. So if you want to pull an update, do it for the corresponding md-file. Contributions and corrections (I'm not a native english speaker) are welcome! Proposals to work on one of the ideas are welcome too.

I've started to collect these ideas somewhere in 2011. Here is a small selection of these:

## 1. Online Syntax Highlighter for Print

Sometimes I want to review some code in RapGenius style. And the most awesome way I know seems to be prnting it out. But what if you don't have an IDE at hand? What if you want to have a certain color scheme? What if your configured color scheme in the IDE looks shitty on paper? Why not host a nice static site with configurable color schemes for that?
 
*Examples of usage:*

 * Print the code at some print shop and enjoy reviewing at your favorite Cafe
 * Review the code using a good looking color scheme

*Examples:*

 * [http://tohtml.com/](http://tohtml.com/)

## 2. Visual Decryption of Scientific Papers

Not all good scientists are good writers/artists. I believe there is a need to visually decrypt scientific papers online (at least the classics). When I was writing my Diploma Thesis, I had to go through about 20-30 papers. Well, as much as you might enjoy the writing style of some of them, it's astonishing how much simpler you can explain the core ideas of the paper after you grasp them. In most cases some nice drawn examples spare you hours of trying to understand the text you are reading.

*Examples:*

 * [Bret Victor - Scientific Communication](http://worrydream.com/#!/ScientificCommunicationAsSequentialArt)

*Extensions:*

 * You can host and update these visual decryptions on GitHub

## 3. RapGenius for Scientific Papers

People that do science usually don't like to explain some thing twice. Why not centralize it? Imagine Feynman and Einstein being able to simultaniously post comments on your favorite physical text.

## 4. Badoo + Vine

Ever tried to hustle a date online? If yes, you might stumble on the same major observation: you can photoshop a candy out of shit. While Badoo, Lovoo and similar sites do an amazing job to add some game-like behaviour to the task of online dating, photos are not enough. We need video. 7 seconds might be enough for that.

## 5. 2 People Near Eachother App

When you meet someone at a crowded place (which is not rare in big cities), you sometimes waste time on finding eachother. Assuming most people have smartphones, why not make an app with a single purpose: show the direction the other person is? I mean, I call you - you share me a link which shares your current location, I accept it - and BAAM! I see which way I have to go to find you.

## 6. 3D Photoshop

Imagine Photoshop. You draw an image - and then edit the depth mask of it. Then you change your camera angle, draw again, on a current 3D model, then edit depth mask. Repeat until you get what you want.

*Examples of usage:*

 * A designer sketching a level for a 3D game.
 * Converting a photo into a 3D model.

## 7. Stock Predictions Exploiting Stock Predictions

After seeing a really nifty DefCon vid about exploiting spammers, imagine exploiting stock predictions. You figure out a certain widely used way to predict stocks (Hi-Frequency Trading, for example) - and figure out if you can exploit the exploit.

*Meta-Idea:*

 * Exploit exploits
